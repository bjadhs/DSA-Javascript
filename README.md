# 6. zigzag conversion
- 

# 9. palindrome number
- Initially tried by converting int to string and checking start and end match
- Second modulus reminder reversing and check 

# 2sum and 3sum
- First tried 2 sum where initiallizing Map is best approach to check by .has and get, set
- 3 sum problem started with sorting the array and using 2 pointer method is the best approach as O(n^2) time complexity efficient rather than brute force approach
- Moving j and k position based on sum greater or small check until j < k
- There was duplicate array output, I need to escape repeated i, j and k
